## Chess Game
This is a Chess Game that I made. The program consists of three modules:
* Client: The client-side interface, where users can register, sign in, search for games, and join ongoing matches through a Command Line UI.
* Server: The server-side code responsible for handling game data and interactions, utilizing HTML and WebSockets to manage real-time updates and database interactions.
* Shared: This module defines the core rules of chess and encapsulates the game logic.
